# Data Science Project GitHub Repo Template

This repo provides a template structure for Python-based data science projects. It includes commonly used directories, including `notebooks/`, `data/`, and `src/` directories, and files for efficient setup of the src code and conda environment. 

## Initial Setup

To utilize this repo, first fork and clone the repo. Then go into the repo settings, and check the box for "Template repository." This will enable you to quickly use this template in the future.

Once you are ready to use the template to create your own data science repo, click "Use this template" on your forked copy of the repo's homepage. It will copy all of the repo structure and files into a new repo. Super easy!

## Setting up the src code and customizing the conda environment

The conda environment in `environment.yml` is a starter environment, only for setting up the repo. I include instructions for renaming and customizing the conda environment after the initial installation is complete.
